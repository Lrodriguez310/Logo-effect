         Hello, my name is Luis Rodriguez. I have a deep passion for making websites! I usually stay up until late hours of the night coding up a new website for fun. I'm actually
         coding this page for fun at 2:00 AM !!!! Sheesh is that passion or what? *clears throat* Where was I... Oh yea! I love going around my community and checking out everyones websites. I usually look at 
         their design and think to myself.. I can make it better! Making a website better takes a good eye for UI and UX. I'll let you be the judge. If you navigate 
         to my Portfolio you will find some of my recent work. I have been dabbling in REACT.JS a lot lately, and let me tell you I'm having a blast! Feel free to look around and learn more about me.
